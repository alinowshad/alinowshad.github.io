Welcome to my webpage!Â  I'm currently a Ph.D student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), honorably under the supervision of Prof. [Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my master's degree from the [Politecnico di Milano (Polytechnic University of Milan (polimi))](https://www.polimi.it/en/) in 2025.

My research interests lie at the intersection of the data mining, data management and deep learning.
